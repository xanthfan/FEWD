Website that tracks your mood, and everyone else's.

Use cartoon faces as way of confirming mood. Can suggest new faces / emotions. 

Can have user query by location, education, age group, ethnicity, etc, and even request new indexes.

Also, track the emotional state of others around them (At home, work, social circle)

Audience : people who are not feeling happy at the present time (because happy people wouldn't be particularly curious about how other people are feeling)

What I want people to do with the information: feel better about their situation (they are not alone) Let them see some commonality with the situation of other people. Get them looking for solutions to their problems. 

Get them to see this within a few minutes. Get them coming back ... how?

Interactivity? - get as many visitors actually participating in poll and looking for information.
