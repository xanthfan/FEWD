		<p class="about">Van Halen is an American hard rock band formed in Pasadena, California in 1972. From 1974 until 1985 the band was composed of guitarist Eddie Van Halen, vocalist David Lee Roth, drummer Alex Van Halen and bassist Michael Anthony. This line-up was changed when David Lee Roth was replaced as vocalist by Sammy Hagar. Critics and fans alike consider its 1978 debut album, Van Halen one of the most "original and revolutionary albums to change rock and roll."</p>

		<p>The band went on to further success, and by the early 1980s they were one of the most successful rock acts of the time. 1984, released in the same year as the name of the album, was their most successful. With the lead single, "Jump", becoming an international hit, and their only single to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100, and the following singles, "Panama" and "I'll Wait", both hitting number 13 on the US charts. The album went on to sell over 12 million copies in the US alone. In 1985, the band replaced current lead singer David Lee Roth with ex-Montrose lead vocalist Sammy Hagar. Under Hagar, the group released four US number-one albums over the course of 11 years. Hagar left the band in 1996 shortly before the release of the band's first greatest hits collection, Best Of, Volume I. Ex-Extreme frontman Gary Cherone was quickly recruited as lead singer to replace Hagar, and Van Halen III was released in 1998. Cherone left the band in frustration in 1999 after the tour due to the poor commercial performance of the album.</p>
